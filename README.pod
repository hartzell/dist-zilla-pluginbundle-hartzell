Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::HARTZELL - My standard dzil config.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.008

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   # in dist.ini
   [@HARTZELL]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This, a L<Dist::Zilla> PluginBundle that builds things the way that I
do, is a work in progress.

I left my standard PluginBundle behind when I left my previous job and
I've discovered that I've fallen behind the state of the art.  This is
my attempt to catch back up.  After browsing the bevy of bundles on
CPAN I decided to model mine on DAGOLDEN's (I like his use of
ConfigSlicer and various config options).  As it stands now it's
nearly a copy of his work but as my personal preferences assert
themselves I expect it to diverge.  For now I have a lot of
github and Meta info stuff to catch up on.

In its default form it is roughly equivalent to the following
dist.ini:

   ; version provider
   [Git::NextVersion]  ; get version from last release tag
   version_regexp = ^release-(.+)$
 
   ; choose files to include
   [Git::GatherDir]         ; everything from git ls-files
   exclude_filename = README.pod   ; skip this generated file
   exclude_filename = META.json    ; skip this generated file
   exclude_filename = cpanfile     ; skip this generated file
 
   [PruneCruft]        ; default stuff to skip
   [ManifestSkip]      ; if -f MANIFEST.SKIP, skip those, too
 
   ; file modifications
   [PkgVersion]        ; add $VERSION = ... to all files
   [PodWeaver]         ; generate Pod
   config_plugin = @HARTZELL
 
   ; generated files
   [ReadmeFromPod]     ; from Pod (runs after PodWeaver)
   [License]           ; boilerplate license
   [ReadmeAnyFromPod]  ; create README.md in repo directory
   type = pod          ; this makes github happy....
   filename = README.pod
   location = root
 
   ; t tests
   [Test::Compile]     ; make sure .pm files all compile
   fake_home = 1       ; fakes $ENV{HOME} just in case
 
   ; xt tests
   [Test::PodSpelling] ; xt/author/pod-spell.t
   [Test::Perl::Critic]; xt/author/critic.t

   directory = t
   directory = xt
   directory = examples
   directory = corpus

   ; build system
   [ExecDir]           ; include 'bin/*' as executables
   [ShareDir]          ; include 'share/' for File::ShareDir

   [ConfirmRelease]    ; prompt before uploading
 
   ; releaser

   ; after release
   [Git::Commit / Commit_Dirty_Files] ; commit Changes (as released)
   allow_dirty = dist.ini
   allow_dirty = Changes
   allow_dirty = README.pod
 
   [Git::Tag]          ; tag repo with custom tag
   tag_format = release-%v
 
   ; NextRelease acts *during* pre-release to write $VERSION and
   ; timestamp to Changes and  *after* release to add a new {{$NEXT}}
   ; section, so to act at the right time after release, it must actually
   ; come after Commit_Dirty_Files but before Commit_Changes in the
   ; dist.ini.  It will still act during pre-release as usual
 
   [NextRelease]
 
   [Git::Commit / Commit_Changes] ; commit Changes (for new dev)
   commit_msg = bump Changes
 
   [Git::Push]         ; push repo to remote
   push_to = origin

=head2 Usage

To use this PluginBundle, just add it to your dist.ini.  See the
L</ATTRIBUTES> section for user configurable options.

This PluginBundle supports ConfigSlicer, so you can pass in options to
individual plugins directly if necessary.

   [@HARTZELL]
   ExecDir.dir = scripts ; overrides ExecDir's dir option

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 stopwords

Moose ArrayRef attribute that keeps track of a list of stopwords for
various spelling tasks.  Defaults to an empty list, controlled by
'stopwords' lines in the dist.ini.  There can be multiple stopwords
lines in the dist.ini file.

Do this:

  stopwords = one two three
  stopwords = some more words

to build up your own list of stopwords.

=head2 fake_release

Moose boolean attribute, when set to true the bundle swaps the
FakeRelease plugin in place of the UploadToCPAN plugin. Mostly useful
for testing a dist.ini without risking a real release.  Defaults to
false, controlled by the value of the 'fake_release' dist.ini option.

Do this:

  fake_release = 1

to do a fake release.  

=head2 no_critic

Moose boolean attribute, when set to true it disables the Perl::Critic
tests.  Defaults to false, controlled by the value of the 'no_critic'
dist.ini option.

Do this:

  no_critic = 1

to do disable critic testing.

=head2 no_spellcheck

Moose boolean attribute, when set to true it disables the
Test::PodSpelling tests.  Defaults to false, controlled by the value
of the 'no_spellcheck' dist.ini option.

Do this:

  no_spellcheck = 1

to do disable spell checking.

=head2 is_task

Moose boolean attribute, when set to true it loads TaskWeaver instead
of PodWeaver.  Defaults to false, controlled by the value of the
'is_task' dist.ini option.

Do this:

  is_task = 1

to build a Task:: distribution.

=head2 use_autoprereqs

Moose boolean attribute, when set to true it loads the AutoPrereqs
plugin.  Defaults to true, controlled by the value of the
'use_autoprereqs' dist.ini option.

Do this:

  use_autoprereqs = 0

to do disable AutoPrereqs.

=head2 tag_format

Moose Str attribute, defines the format used by Git::Tag.  Defaults to
'release-%v', controlled by the value of the 'tag_format' dist.ini option.

Do this:

  tag_format = my-release-%v

to set it to something other than the default.

=head2 version_regexp

Moose Str attribute, defines the regexp that Git::NextVersion uses to
figure out the current version.  Defaults to '^release-(.+)$' and is
controlled by the value of the 'version_regexp' dist.ini option.

Do this:

  version_regexp = ^my-release-(.+)$

to set it to something other than the default.

=head2 weaver_config

Moose Str attribute, controls the name of the PodWeaver configuration.
Defaults to '@HARTZELL', controlled by the value of the 'weaver_config'
dist.ini option.

Do this:

  weaver_config = @DAGOLDEN

to e.g. use Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::DAGOLDEN.

=head2 git_remote

Moose Str attribute, controls the name of the git remote.  Defaults to
'origin', controlled by the value of the 'git_remote' dist.ini option.

Do this:

  git_remote = 'something_else'

to use something other than the default.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 mvp_multivalue_args

Returns the list of the dist.ini options that can take multiple
values.  Currently returns qw/stopwords/.

=head2 configure

Does the heavy lifting, adds the plugins, etc....

=head1 COMMON PATTERNS

=head2 nothing much to see here for now....
